#    The source code of the scales used during 42's peer-evaluations is a      #
#  YAML description. This description is then uploaded to the school's         #
#  intranet by the Pedago team in order to generate the web form that the      #
#  students will use for peer-evaluation.                                      #
#                                                                              #
#    This template documents in detail the style and content of a scale's      #
#  YAML description. As a consequence, this template is a perfect starting     #
#  point to write your own scale. Please don't hesitate to delete documentation#
#  comment boxes such as this one once your scale is complete, but also be     #
#  careful not to delete chaptering comment boxes in order to help anyone      #
#  who might work on this scale after you. Documentation boxes have the '%'    #
#  character in their bottom right corner to help you identify them.           #
#  Chaptering boxes don't have it.                                             #

#    The architecture of the scales of regular projects allows you to group    #
#  together questions about a common topic under a same section. The author    #
#  of the scale of a regular project can organize his or her sections and      #
#  their questions as he or she wishes, but the following requirements must    #
#  be respected:                                                               #

#    - A scale is always made of a header block followed by one or more        #
#      section blocks.                                                         #
#    - Each section block is always made of one or more question blocks.       #

#    42 uses a "skills" system inspired from role playing games to represent   #
#  the abilities of the students. 2 to 4 skills are assigned to each projet,   #
#  and each time a student succeeds, he or she earns experience points         #
#  for the project's matching skills. Here is the comprehensive list of the    #
#  skills in use at 42:                                                        #

#    A scale couples a distinct bank of 100 points to EACH selected skill,     #
#  NOT a single bank of 100 points shared among the 2 to 4 selected skills.    #
#  Each bank must be allocated to the different questions.                     #

#    Let's take a simple example. Let a project named "Lube" use the skills    #
#  "Group & interpersonal", "Adaptation & creativity" and "Web".               #
#  As a consequence, 100 points are allocated to "Group & interpersonal",      #
#  100 points to "Adaptation & creativity", and 100 points to "Web".           #
#  Let's imagine that the scale has 2 sections with 3 questions per section,   #
#  the author could spend his or her banks like:                               #

#    In the submodule "resources/" coupled to your repository, you will find   #
#  a script named "scale_validator.rb". This script takes a scale description  #
#  file as a parameter, such as the one you are reading right now, and checks  #
#  its syntax and semantics. In case of error, the problematic parts of your   #
#  description will be highlighted. Please note that you will also find the    #

  In order to maintain high evaluation standards, you are expected to:

  - Remain polite, courteous, respectful and constructive at every moment
    of the discussion. Trust between you and our community depends on
    your behaviour.

  - Highlight the flaws and issues you uncover in the turned-in
    work to the evaluated student or team, and take the time to discuss
    every aspect extensively.

  - Please take into account that discrepancies regarding the expected
    work or functionalities definitions might occur. Keep an open
    mind towards the opposite party (is he or she right or wrong?),
    and grade as honestly as possible. 42's pedagogy only makes
    sense if peer-evaluations are carried out seriously.

  - You must grade only what exists in the GiT repository of the
    student or team.

  - Remember to check the GiT repository's ownership: is it the
    student's or team's repository, and for the right project?

  - Check thoroughly that no wicked aliases have been used to trick
    you into grading something other than the genuine repository.

  - Any script supposed to ease the evaluation provided by one party
    must be thoroughly checked be the other party in order to avoid unpleasant
    situations.

  - If the student in charge of the grading hasn't done the project
    yet, it is mandatory that he or she reads it before starting the
    evaluation.

  - Use the available flags on this scale to tag an empty work, a non
    functional work, a coding style ("norm") error if applicable,
    cheating, and so on. If a flag is set, the grade is 0 (or -42 in
    case of cheating). However, cheating case excluded, you are encouraged
    to carry on discussing what went wrong, why, and how to address it,
    even if the grading itself is over.

#   In the introduction of this file, I explained how skill points are spread  #
#   among skills: each bank of 100 skill points must be spread throughout      #
#   the questions of the scale. That is true, but I didn't mention the notion  #
#   of bonus points on pupose to keep things simple at first. Once a student   #
#   or a team manages do to all the expected work for a project, they are      #
#   encouraged to go further by doing the "bonuses" of said project. Bonuses   #
#   are rewarded with additional points not included in the 100 points of      #
#   each bank. Actually, each skill has two banks: 100 standard points + 25    #
#   bonus points.                                                              #
#   The 'kind' entry allows the author to choose if the points coupled to this #
#   question are withdrawn from the skills' standard banks (100 points each)   #
#   or from their bonus banks (25 points each).                                #
#   Bonuses are obviously not mandatory but they can be used to reward         #
#   particularly good projects with the max grade of 125 for each selected     #
#   skill.                                                                     #
#   The 'kind' entry must be set either to the value 'standard' or to the value#
#   'bonus'. Please understand that whatever the value chosen for this entry,  #
#   every point of every skill will be withdrawn from the corresponding bank.  #
#   It is NOT possible to withdraw points from the standard bank of a skill    #
#   and in the same question to withdraw points from the bonus bank of another #
#   skill.                                                                     #
