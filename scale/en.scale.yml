  - Remain polite, courteous, respectful and constructive
  throughout the evaluation process. The well-being of the community
  depends on it.

  - Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual
  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss
  and debate the problems you have identified.

  - You must consider that there might be some difference in how your
  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the
  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade
  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and
  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.

  - Only grade the work that is in the student or group's
  GiT repository.

  - Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student
  or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project
  and also check that "git clone" is used in an empty folder.

  - Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you
  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the
  official repository.

  - To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating
  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used
  to facilitate the grading.

  - If the evaluating student has not completed that particular
  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the
  entire subject prior to starting the defence.

  - Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,
  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,
  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of
  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are
  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not
  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused
  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.
  
  - Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,
  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected
  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the
  appropriate flag. 
  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.
  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the 
  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.

  - You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must
  be properly freed before the end of execution.
  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as
  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.

      Carry out AT LEAST the following tests to try to stress the error
      management
      - Pass an arbitrary file descriptor to the get_next_line function on
      which it is not possible to read, for example 42. The function must
      return -1.
      - Check the error returns for read, malloc, and open.
