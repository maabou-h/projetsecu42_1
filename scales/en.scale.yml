  description: "If cheating is suspected, the evaluation stops here. Use the \"Cheat\" flag of the scale. 
    => FYI cheating means the student who is suspected cannot explain of recreate their own code, or he's used elements specifically forbidden in the subject (ex: forbidden functions) or that go against school policies.
    Please do this calmly, wisely and with caution."

        - Defense can only happen if the student being evaluated is present. This way everybody progresses : by exchanging ideas and sharing knowledge with each other.
        - Nothing submitted (or wrong file or directory) : 0, evaluation is over.
        - As soon as you come accross an exercise that isn't fully fonctional, evaluation stops. The following exercises won't be evaluated.
        - In order to grade your peer, you have to clone their git repository on their station.
